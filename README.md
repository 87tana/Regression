# Regression
Projects based on regression approaches

## Bike Sharing
The main goal is to predict rent (count feature) using the given parameters. The management department will use the results to understand how the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and customer expectations.

I specifically answer which factors contribute most to the number of bicycles checked out over a given day. To answer this question, I build and train a Regression Model on the Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) Kaggle dataset.
